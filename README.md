### Expense Tracker Project using Front End and Back End

In the client folder you will find the FE components and that is using React with Hooks and Context.

The Back End is under construction but will be using Node and Express.

As for the database, it will be using MongoDB ( yet to be learned and added).

Please see each folder and their respective files in order to understand the code.

Thank you and sorry for the confusion!

I would like to thank Traversy Media for the amazing resources that is put on the internet and made available
to everyone to learn by creating these projects. Thank you!
